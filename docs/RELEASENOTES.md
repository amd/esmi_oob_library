# Supported BMCs
Compile this library for any BMC running linux. Please use the [APML Library/tool Support](https://github.com/amd/esmi_oob_library/issues) to provide your feedback.

# Supported Operating Systems
APML Library is tested on OpenBMC for Aspeed and RPI based BMCs with the following "System requirements"

# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
BMC with I2C/I3C controller as master, I2C/I3C master adapter channel (SCL and SDA lines) connected to the "Supported Processors"

## Software requirements

In order to build the APML library, the following components are required. Note that the software versions listed are what is being used in development. Earlier versions are not guaranteed to work:

### Compilation requirements
* CMake (v3.5.0)
* APML library upto v1.1 depends on libi2c-dev
* Doxygen (1.8.13)
* latex (pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18)

# Dependencies
APML library upto v1.1 depends on libi2c-dev
Later versions depends on the apml_modules (hosted github.com/amd/apml_modules)

# Support
To provide your feedback, bug reports, support and feature requests.
